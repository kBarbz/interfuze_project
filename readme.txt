#### Assumptions Made
- Increase or decrease based on comparing avg rainfall in the last 4 hours with avg rainfall more than 4 hours ago
- Yellow is a suitable substitution for amber
- The color doesn't need to be explicitly written when displaying results
- 2 decimal places is sufficient for the display of average rainfall
