#### Assumptions Made
- Increase or decrease based on comparing avg rainfall in the last 4 hours with avg rainfall more than 4 hours ago
- Yellow is a suitable substitution for amber
- The color doesn't need to be explicitly written when displaying results
- 2 decimal places is sufficient for the display of average rainfall
- rainfall is in mm
- rainfall data for all csv's will always be in mm
- datetime is always correctly formatted
- there are no other devices that aren't included in Devices.csv; no devices are created based solely on Data csv's
- csv's containing devices and csv's containing data will be put in two seperate folders
